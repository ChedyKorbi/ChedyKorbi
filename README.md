## About

I’m an early-career software engineer building my way into **AI, machine learning, and data-driven systems**, with a strong foundation in **systems engineering, IoT, and full-stack web & mobile development**.

My background spans real-world internships and freelance projects where I designed and delivered **production-oriented platforms** — from IoT ecosystems and secure traceability systems to ML-assisted mobile applications and scalable backend services. I’m particularly interested in **end-to-end ML systems**, where data engineering, model design, deployment, and system constraints matter as much as the algorithms themselves.

Currently pursuing an **Engineering Degree (Cycle Ingénieur) in Big Data & Artificial Intelligence**, I focus on building practical AI systems that are **explainable, scalable, and grounded in real product needs**.

## Focus Areas

- Applied Machine Learning & Data Engineering  
- End-to-End ML Pipelines (data → model → deployment)  
- AI-assisted decision systems & explainable scoring models  
- IoT, Edge Intelligence & real-time data pipelines  
- Backend & system design for production environments

## What I Care About

I’m less interested in buzzwords and more interested in **how systems actually work in production** — data quality, trade-offs, explainability, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

I use GitHub to document:
- Applied ML experiments
- System architectures
- End-to-end projects
- Learning paths toward production-ready AI systems
